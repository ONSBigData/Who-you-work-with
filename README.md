# Who you work with

The [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) Methodology Group leads on the statistical methods and techniques that underpin all ONS surveys and statistical outputs.

The data underpinning this [interactive](https://onsbigdata.github.io/Who-you-work-with/index.html) maps the [Centre of Expertise of the Methodology Group](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologycontacts) to their stakeholders within ONS to understand the relationships and priority of interactions between the two.

The size of the arrow represents the 2015/2016 [Full Time Equivalent (FTE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent) metric, ie number of allocated employee working full-time to projects for/in collaboration with the stakeholder. Therefore, the size of the arrow is representative of the strength of the relationship between two nodes.

The visualisation was created using [D3.js v3](https://d3js.org/).
